# Persistency

Implementation of persistent data structures in Rust.

The goal is to have efficient implementations of various data structures in both fully persistent and partially persistent versions. Addtionaly the crate aims to provide building blocks for building custom persistent data structures safely and efficiently.

Everything is experimental and poorly tested if at all. No APIs are currently considered stable.
